# Remote Control Car

A DIY Remote Control Car built using a 3D printer and Arduino that can be wirelessly controlled by smartphone using Bluetooth. 

## Objectives
* **Mechanical Design** - Design and build the mechanical components of the car using OnShape (open source CAD Software) and a 3D Printer.
* **Electronics** - Use basic electrical components (Arduino, servo motors, etc) to control the car.
* **Wireless Control** - Wirelessly connect to the car using a bluetooth module and design an app to control the car.
* **[Website](https://doug-matthews.github.io/Remote-Control-Car/)** - Create a website to document the project.

## Current Progress

* **Completed** 
  * Designed and built the basic chassis of the car.
  * Found a template for the website and added some content.
  * Obtained a bluetooth module and tested its functionality.
